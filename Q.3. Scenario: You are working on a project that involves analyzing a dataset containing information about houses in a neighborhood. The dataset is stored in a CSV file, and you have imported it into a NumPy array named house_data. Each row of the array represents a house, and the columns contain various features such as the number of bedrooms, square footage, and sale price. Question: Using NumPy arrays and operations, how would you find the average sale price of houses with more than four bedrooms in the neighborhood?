//3. Scenario: You are working on a project that involves analyzing a dataset containing information about houses in a neighborhood. The dataset is stored in a CSV file, and you have imported it into a NumPy array named house_data. Each row of the array represents a house, and the columns contain various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and sale price.
Question: Using NumPy arrays and operations, how would you find the average sale price of houses with more than four bedrooms in the neighborhood?

import numpy as np
houses_with_more_than_4_bedrooms = house_data[house_data[:, 0] > 4]
sale_prices = houses_with_more_than_4_bedrooms[:, 2]
average_sale_price = np.mean(sale_prices)
print(f"The average sale price of houses with more than 4 bedrooms is: ${average_sale_price:.2f}")
