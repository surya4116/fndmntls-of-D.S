//5. Scenario: You are a data analyst working for a car manufacturing company. As part of your analysis, you have a dataset containing information about the fuel efficiency of different car models. The dataset is stored in a NumPy array named fuel_efficiency, where each element represents the fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon) of a specific car model. Your task is to calculate the average fuel efficiency and determine the percentage improvement in fuel efficiency between two car models.
Question: How would you use NumPy arrays and arithmetic operations to calculate the average fuel efficiency and determine the percentage improvement in fuel efficiency between two car models?


import numpy as np
average_fuel_efficiency = np.mean(fuel_efficiency)
fuel_efficiency_model_1 = fuel_efficiency[0]  # First model (index 0)
fuel_efficiency_model_2 = fuel_efficiency[1]  # Second model (index 1)
percentage_improvement = ((fuel_efficiency_model_2 - fuel_efficiency_model_1) / fuel_efficiency_model_1) * 100
print(f"Average fuel efficiency: {average_fuel_efficiency:.2f} miles per gallon")
print(f"Percentage improvement in fuel efficiency from Model 1 to Model 2: {percentage_improvement:.2f}%")
