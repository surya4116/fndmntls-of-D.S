//2. Scenario: You are a data analyst working for a company that sells products online. You have been tasked with analyzing the sales data for the past month. The data is stored in a NumPy array.
Question: How would you find the average price of all the products sold in the past month? Assume 3x3 matrix with each row representing the sales for a different product


import numpy as np
sales_data = np.array([[100, 150, 200], 
                        [250, 300, 350], 
                        [400, 450, 500]])
average_price = np.mean(sales_data)
print(f"Average price of all products sold: {average_price}")
